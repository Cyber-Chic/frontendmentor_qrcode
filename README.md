## My process

### Built with

I learned how to add and position images, use headers, format my code using Prettier and how to use an internal CSS style sheet.

### Useful resources

- [Prettier Â· Opinionated Code Formatter](https://prettier.io/) - This helped me format my code.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This is where I found the font included in this project.
